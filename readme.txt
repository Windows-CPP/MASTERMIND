MASTERMIND v3.0 'README'
Developed by Robert Castro, AKA StG_44

- About - 
'MASTERMIND' is a board game by Mordecai Meirowitz, which was itself interpreted from the pencil and paper game, 'Bulls and Cows.' 
This program is an interpretation of MASTERMIND that has been translated onto a computer for recreational use. 
On top of those uses, I'm programming MASTERMIND as a program for FBLA Arizona events.

- Difficulty -
There are three different levels, referred to as "Seq_1, "Seq_2", and "Seq_3".
With each difficulty increase, two more digits are added to the code.
So, the code digits go from: 4 Digits, to 6 Digits, to 8 Digits accordingly. 

- About the License & Game Content -
While MASTERMIND is not completely finsihed yet (v3.0 should be the saving grace of the game, with all new features), I am unsure what license to use. 
I've heard of places like itch.io, I don't know whether I should upload it there. 
For now, I'll keep the game open-source under the GNU GPLv3 license; But that may be subject to change, along with the fate of the game. 
On top of this, a lot of credit goes to Meirowitz for the original idea of Mastermind, and I'm just expanding on it.
